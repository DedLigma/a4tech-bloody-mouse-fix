## a4tech bloody mouse fix for linux

## About
Ð•his fix is designed to eliminate the strange behavior of the mouse when it behaves like a gamepad (the mouse has dead zones like a gamepad stick).

## Why does the mouse behave strangely
This happens because the event files of the mouse are split. To fix this problem, you need to merge them using evsieve. However, depending on the linux kernel type, the event file numbers may change after each system boot. This fix detects which event files your mouse uses and merges them together.

## Requirements
Install [evsieve](https://github.com/KarsMulder/evsieve)

## How to use the fix
First, determine which event files your mouse is using. `sudo evtest`
Usually, the difference in event file numbers is 2. If this is not the case, change line 4 in the mouseFix file
```
eventNumber=$(($eventNumber+2))
```
to
```
eventNumber=$(($eventNumber+<your-difference>)) 
```
Then find which file creates these event files. You can do this either by looking at the links in the file properties of `/dev/input/by-id`, or by using udevadm
```
udevadm info /dev/input/event<your-number>
```
you need lines like this
```
S: input/by-path/pci-0000:00:14.0-usb-0:3:1.1-event-mouse
S: input/by-id/usb-COMPANY_USB_Device-if01-event-mouse
```
